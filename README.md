Developed an Admin side functional Employee_management System using Python for logic and Tkinter Python-GUI library for the user-interface. 

### ✨ Features

The system provides the following basic functionalities:

- **SAVE**: Add a new employee's details to the system.
- **UPDATE**: Modify an existing employee's information.
- **CLEAR**: Reset the input fields.
- **DELETE**: Remove an employee's record from the system.
- **SEARCH**: Look up employee details using specific criteria.

### 🔎 Search Functionality

The admin can search for the details of a particular employee using the `SEARCH_BY` option. You can search either by:

- **Phone Number**: Find employees by their phone number.
- **ID-Proof**: Find employees using their ID proof.
